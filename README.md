# Java Full Stack Development Journey

## Introduction
Welcome to my **Java Full Stack Development Journey**! This repository contains all the code and projects I am working on to enhance my skills as I strive to become a **Software Development Engineer (SDE)**.

As I progress, I will be uploading challenges, practice programs, and projects related to Java, object-oriented programming (OOP), and other full-stack technologies. This will also include my learning of backend technologies, databases, frameworks, and much more.

## Skills & Technologies Learned
Here are some of the core skills and technologies I've been working on:

- **Java Programming** (Core Java, OOP concepts, Exception Handling)
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism**
- **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**
- **Collections Framework**
- **Lambda Expressions**
- **Database Connectivity** (JDBC)
- **Spring Framework** (coming soon)
- **Frontend Technologies** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Databases** (MySQL, PostgreSQL)

## Projects & Challenges

### 1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practice**
- Implemented OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and abstraction.
- Created multiple practice programs to reinforce OOP principles.

### 2. **Payment System with Abstract Classes**
- Created a payment system that handles multiple payment types (Credit Card, Debit Card, UPI).
- Implemented abstract classes and method overriding for polymorphism.
- Added random transactional ID generation for each payment type.

### 3. **Vehicle System with Inheritance**
- Built a system for **Vehicle**, **Car**, **Bike**, and **Truck** using inheritance.
- Showed how to create class hierarchies and implement specialized behaviors.

## How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or later
- IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code recommended)

### Steps to run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Java-Full-Stack-Development.git

2. Navigate to the project directory and open it in your IDE.
3. Run the Java classes by right-clicking and selecting Run As > Java Application.
4. Enjoy exploring the projects and code!

## Future Goals

* Deep dive into Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security).
* Learn Frontend Technologies like React and Angular.
* Build Full-Stack Projects with REST APIs.
* Contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers.
